# Description

    This project provides POC code to explore [OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)
    authorization flows and how they can be abused in phishing attacks.
    
    Specifically, we demonstrate a phishing attack using the device authorization grant
    on Microsoft and intend to add additional flows as we go. An implementation of this 
    is written in generic Powershell and can be run on any supported platform. Most cmdlet
    calls are simple REST API calls and should be translateable to any language.

# Directories / Files
    device_code/pwsh/
        demo_msft.ps1       - main Powershell file. Usage: powershell|pwsh -h
        demo_cfg.json       - required config file
        demo_email.txt      - email template if sending phish email
