# Description

    This project provides POC code to explore [OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)
    authorization flows and how they can be abused in phishing attacks.
    
    Specifically, we demonstrate a phishing attack using the device authorization grant
    on Microsoft and intend to add additional flows as we go. An implementation of this 
    is written in generic Powershell and can be run on any supported platform. Most cmdlet
    calls are simple REST API calls and should be translateable to any language.

# Running the Code
1. [Install Powershell 7.x](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.1)
2. Setup Microsoft Environment (for the victim)
    - Within Azure AD, create user account
    - Enable Office 365 and ensure user has access to Outlook
    - Ensure user has read access to an Azure subscription and resources
    - **NOTE: the attacker does not need a Microsoft account or environment**
3. Configure demo_cfg.json
    - Set SMTP settings if you want to have the demo code send an email phish
    - Keep other config settings as is (page=true, interactive=true, verbose=1, etc.)
4. Run
    - command-line: `Powershell.exe|pwsh demo_msft.ps1 -config demo_cfg.json`
    - Step #0: user and device codes generated
    - Step #1: phish email sent (to user/victim set in demo_cfg.json)
    - Step #2: will loop waiting for user/victim to authenticate/authorize
    - In browser, <log in as user/victim to login.microsoft.com, check Outlook, follow phishing email link, authenticate)
    - Step #3: retrieve user''s oauth access tokens
    - Step #4: use access token to list users in Azure AD
    - Step #5: retrieve user''s email
    - Step #6: move laterally and use refresh token to get new access token for Azure
    - Step #7: will list resources within Azure subscriptions that the user/victim has access to

# Directories / Files
    device_code/pwsh/
        demo_msft.ps1       - main Powershell file. Usage: powershell|pwsh -h
        demo_cfg.json       - required config file
        demo_email.txt      - email template if sending phish email
